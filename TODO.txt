TODO/NOTES


Filters:

Use hash table for filters instead of list.


History:

Track individual page history for each tab so that multiple tabs can
be used for data collection.


Graph implementation:

Construct an adjacency list.

Each node will have following attributes:
  Number of times visited.
  Number of times arrived at from external site (entrance node).
  Number of times left from to external site (exit node).

Directed edges between nodes within the network showing navigation with:
  Number of times link was traversed.

Persistent storage of graph.


Visualization:

Use thejit.org graph visualizations to show the graphs.

The graph visualization can be filtered on above attributes and also
by domain.

Nodes can be shown as pie charts with breakdowns?
