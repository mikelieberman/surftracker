Graph implementation:

Construct an adjacency list.

Each node will have following attributes:
  Number of times visited.
  Number of times arrived at from external site (entrance node).
  Number of times left from to external site (exit node).

Directed edges between nodes within the network showing navigation with:
  Number of times link was traversed.


Visualization:

Use thejit.org graph visualizations to show the graphs.

The graph visualization can be filtered on above attributes and also
by domain.

Nodes can be shown as pie charts with breakdowns?
